Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _6.685 Electric Machines_ as it was taught by Prof. James L. Kirtley Jr. in Fall 2013.

This course is taught with a classical approach to electromechanics. The course is motivated by understanding phenomena and addressing design-oriented problems through a rigorous approach. Examples incorporate current research and emphasize applicability of concepts.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

*   Understanding of principles and analysis of electromechanical systems
*   Mastery of electromechanical design of the major classes of rotating and linear electric machines
*   Ability to estimate the dynamic parameters of electric machines

### Possibilities for Further Study/Careers

This course is pretty much a terminal subject, as there is no more advanced material in this area taught at MIT. Students might also take [_6.641 Electromagnetic Fields, Forces, and Motion_](/courses/6-641-electromagnetic-fields-forces-and-motion-spring-2009/), or courses in heat transfer and structures. Many students who take this course do graduate work in machines, and some pursue PhD’s in the topic. There is a very strong demand for people with a background in this area, so industrial jobs are plentiful for students as well.

Curriculum Information
----------------------

### Prerequisites

[_6.061/6.690 Introduction to Electric Power Systems_](/courses/6-061-introduction-to-electric-power-systems-spring-2011/); or permission of the instructor.

### Requirements Satisfied

    The course is taught in a traditional way. The professor lectures at the front of the room and uses the chalkboards. Students sit in the rows of seats as depicted.

Student Information
-------------------

![Fewer than 10 students take this course each year.](/coursemedia/6-685-electric-machines-fall-2013/3b3be506ac999d8bd55c35c3291afd1d_6-685_stat-students.png)

### Enrollment

Fewer than 10 students took this course in Fall 2013.

### Breakdown by Year

The class for Fall 2013 was fairly small, and mainly comprised of Prof. Kirtley’s own graduate students. Prof. Kirtley shares some thoughts about the class composition: “This course has evolved into something of an apprenticeship for my own graduate students, and I would like to see more students enrolled in the subject. I would like it if MIT were to produce more graduates who know and understand electric machines and electromechanics.”

### Breakdown by Major

Most of the students were PhD candidates in electrical engineering, and a small percentage were PhD candidates in mechanical engineering.

### Typical Student Background

Typically, a student should have some background in electromechanics ([_6.061 Introduction to Electric Power Systems_](/courses/6-061-introduction-to-electric-power-systems-spring-2011/)) and circuits ([_6.002 Circuits and Electronics_](/courses/6-002-circuits-and-electronics-spring-2007/) and [_6.003 Signals and Systems_](/courses/6-003-signals-and-systems-fall-2011/)).

How Student Time Was Spent
--------------------------

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

Lecture
-------

*   Met 2 times per week for 1.5 hours per session; 26 sessions total
*   2 [quizzes]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/exams) were administered during class sessions in lieu of lecture
*   Prof. Kirtley shares some thoughts about the course format: “I teach the subject in a very classical (lecture/problem set/quiz) fashion, but with a lot of personal contact: I am available to talk with, and argue with, students in the class. I really enjoy, and I think the students do too, the give and take that comes from arguing about advanced ('hard') problems.”

Out of Class
------------

*   Readings from the [course notes]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/course-notes), which are recommended before attempting the assignments.
*   11 [problem sets]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments), which are essential to students for mastering the material. Some of the problem sets may also involve the use of a program such as MATLAB® to help with the calculations.
